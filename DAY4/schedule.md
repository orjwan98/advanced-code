**Instructions**:

1. `npm install -g create-react-app`
2. `create-react-app character-search`

- cd into your react's project.

**The project**

We're going to build a search engine where we can look up Rick&Morty cartoon characters based on their species (human, humanoid, alien) and gender (male, female, genderless, unknown).

> How the site should look/work?

- There are two text boxes, one where the user can enter the `species` of the character and another where we can enter the `gender`.
- There has to be a submit button, when clicked, makes a request to the Rick&Morty site and gets back data based on what the user enters.
- Display each character in a seperate component that includes their: name, gender, status, species type, location and image.
- The state should be as private as possible in all components. If you need to pass data from a child to a parent, try to use a function.
- The site should use arrow functions for all functions and functional components.

> Where should I get the data from?

<a href="https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/" target="_blank">rickandmortyapi</a> is going to be the site we make requests to. It has some simple documentation to show you how you can customize your requests.
